    <h1>Chicken Alfredo</h1>
    <img src="img/alfredo.jpeg" alt="Chicken Alfredo Recipe">
    <p>I learned how to make creamy chicken Alfredo from my dad who has always been an incredible cook and amazing teacher. Chicken Alfredo was always my favorite. A lot of the recipes I see that are worthwhile are too much work because you have to make your own sauce, and those that don't have you make your own have no flavor. This recipe shows you how to take plain, bland, store-made sauce and make it more than restaurant-worthy.
