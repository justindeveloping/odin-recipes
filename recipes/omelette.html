    <h1>Classic Ham and Cheese Omelette</h1>
    <img src="img/omelette.jpeg" alt="Ham and Cheese Omelette">
    <p>So easy and so good. I usually saute the ham before adding it to the omelette so it gets crispy and more flavorful.

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>4 slices deli ham, chopped into small pieces</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        <li>freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add ham and cook until browned and crispy, stirring frequently, about 7 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Beat eggs with 1 teaspoon chives, salt, and pepper in a small bowl and add to skillet, tilting skillet to distribute egg evenly on bottom of skillet. Cook until omelette has set at the edges. </li>
        <li>prinkle Cheddar cheese on top and fold omelette in half. Flip and cook until egg is entirely set and cheese inside has melted, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Slide onto a plate and sprinkle with remaining 1 teaspoon chives.</li>
    </ol>
